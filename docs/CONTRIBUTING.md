# Contributing to cli-web-docs

Thank you for your interest! :wave:

This project is run on volunteer time, so please have patience.

## Before you open a PR

1. **Open an issue first.** Every commit in this repo closes a same-repo issue (`closes #N` in the commit body). Discussion happens in the issue; the PR is the change itself. This applies even to trivial fixes - the issue gives the change a stable URL.
2. **Stay close to scope.** The four [cli-* repos](https://github.com/coilysiren?tab=repositories&q=cli-) are intentionally small. Features that pull this package out of its lane will get pushed back, even when well-intentioned. The [README](README.md) and [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md) describe the surface; if your idea expands it, lead with an issue arguing for the expansion.
3. **Run the dev verbs before pushing.** Local dev routes through [`coily`](https://github.com/coilysiren/coily):

   ```
   coily exec build
   coily exec test
   coily exec vet
   coily exec lint
   ```

   The `.coily/coily.yaml` ↔ Makefile contract is checked by `coily lint` and by CI on every push.

4. **Update `godoc-current.txt` if you touch the public API.** Run `coily exec godoc-update` and commit the diff in the same PR. CI fails if the snapshot is out of sync.
